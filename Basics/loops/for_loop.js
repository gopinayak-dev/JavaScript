//Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly

//A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.
/*syntax:
for (initialization; condition; afterthought){}
    statement
}
*/

//suppose need to print uptp 10 numbers
for(let i=1; i<=10; i++){
    console.log(i);
}
