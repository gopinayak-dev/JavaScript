/*Math 
In JavaScript, Math is a built-in global object that provides a set of properties and methods for 
performing various mathematical operations. You can think of it as a utility object for working with 
mathematical functions and constants. Some of the common properties and methods provided by the Math 
object include:
    Constants:
        Math.PI: Represents the mathematical constant Ï€ (pi), which is approximately equal to 3.14159.
        Math.E: Represents the base of natural logarithms, which is approximately equal to 2.71828.

    Basic Math Functions:
        Math.abs(x): Returns the absolute value of a number.
        Math.round(x): Rounds a number to the nearest integer.
        Math.floor(x): Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.
        Math.ceil(x): Rounds a number up to the nearest integer.

    Trigonometric Functions:
        Math.sin(x): Returns the sine of an angle in radians.
        Math.cos(x): Returns the cosine of an angle in radians.
        Math.tan(x): Returns the tangent of an angle in radians.

    Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:
        Math.exp(x): Returns the value of E raised to the power of x.
        Math.log(x): Returns the natural logarithm of x.
        Math.pow(x, y): Returns x raised to the power of y.

    Random Number Generation:
        Math.random(): Generates a pseudo-random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).*/


//console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 10));//this will generate random nos between 0 to 10(exclusive).If we want 10 also then we need to add +1.
console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))//generates nos between 0 to 99
