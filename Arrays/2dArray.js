/*2D Array:
-----------
A two-dimensional array, also known as a 2D array, is a collection of data elements arranged in a grid-like 
structure with rows and columns. Each element in the array is referred to as a cell and can be accessed by 
its row and column indices/indexes. */

let twoDarray = [['a1','a2'], ['b1','b2'], ['c1','c2']];
console.log(twoDarray[0][0]); //accessing first element
console.log(twoDarray[twoDarray.length - 1][(twoDarray[twoDarray.length - 1]).length-1]); //accessing last element
